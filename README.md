# Gan-music-generation
This is a project where a music dataset has been converted to images and this new images dataset is used for training a GAN to figure out patterns. The output has been generated by providing a random 100 sized latent dimension array. The outputs are also images which have been converted to midi files and these are the produced output melodies.
